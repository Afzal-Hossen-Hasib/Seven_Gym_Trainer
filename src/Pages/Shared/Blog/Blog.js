        <h3>Difference between Authorization and Authentication? <hr /></h3>
        <p>
          <span>ANSWER: Authorization:</span> Authorization happens after a
          user’s identity has been successfully authenticated. It is about
          offering full or partial access rights to resources like database,
          funds, and other critical information to get the job done. In an
          organization, for example, after an employee is verified and confirmed
          via ID and password authentication, the next step would be defining
          what resources the employee would have access to. </p>
          <p> <span>Authentication:</span> Authentication is the process of identifying users and validating who they claim to be. One of the most common and obvious factors to authenticate identity is a password. If the user name matches the password credential, it means the identity is valid, and the system grants access to the user.
