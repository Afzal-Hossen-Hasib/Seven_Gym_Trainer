                <p>Becoming a Personal Trainer was an obvious and natural choice for me as I am passionate about healthy living and sharing my expertise and knowledge with people.</p>
                <p>I worked for a number of corporate gyms as well as at an award winning world top 100 hotel at the start of my career but I felt that I could give more value to my clients which went beyond the little time they spent at the gym.</p>
                <p>My training ethos is to encourage, inspire, educate and support clients to achieve the best version of themselves, in a progressive, enjoyable, safe and effective manner.</p>
